## Thinking Path

<!--
  Required. Trace your reasoning from the top of the project down to this
  specific change. Start with what Paperclip is, then narrow through the
  subsystem, the problem, and why this PR exists. Use blockquote style.
  Aim for 5–8 steps. See CONTRIBUTING.md for full examples.

## Linked Issues or Issue Description

<!--
  Required. Pick ONE of the following two paths:

  (A) Issue exists — tag each linked issue with `Fixes: #123`, `Closes #123`,
      or `Refs #123`. Include duplicates and closely related issues too.

  (B) No issue exists — describe the underlying problem here, following the
      relevant issue template so reviewers get the same fields:
        • Bug:     .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml
        • Feature: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml
        • Adapter: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/adapter_request.yml

  See CONTRIBUTING.md → "Link Issues or Describe Them In-PR".

## What Changed

<!-- Bullet list of concrete changes. One bullet per logical unit. -->

-

## Verification

<!--
  How can a reviewer confirm this works? Include test commands, manual
  steps, or both. For UI changes, include before/after screenshots.
-->

-

## Risks

<!--
  What could go wrong? Mention migration safety, breaking changes,
  behavioral shifts, or "Low risk" if genuinely minor.
-->

-

> For core feature work, check [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) first and discuss it in `#dev` before opening the PR. Feature PRs that overlap with planned core work may need to be redirected — check the roadmap first. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Model Used

<!--
  Required. Specify which AI model was used to produce or assist with
  this change. Be as descriptive as possible — include:
    • Provider and model name (e.g., Claude, GPT, Gemini, Codex)
    • Exact model ID or version (e.g., claude-opus-4-6, gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09)
    • Context window size if relevant (e.g., 1M context)
    • Reasoning/thinking mode if applicable (e.g., extended thinking, chain-of-thought)
    • Any other relevant capability details (e.g., tool use, code execution)
  If no AI model was used, write "None — human-authored".
