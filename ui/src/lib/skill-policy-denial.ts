/**
 * @fileoverview Classifies a failed skill mutation into the four visual states
 * from the Phase 3 UX spec (PAP-13865 / §9.10 Company Skill Policy Contract).
 *
 * The contract inverts the old model: **skill permissions are opt-in
 * restrictions, not opt-in capabilities.** Under the open default there is no
 * permission chrome at all — install / edit / update / test / reset / remove
 * are just live buttons. A denial notice only appears when an explicit company
 * policy (State B) or a non-configurable platform invariant (State C) actually
 * denied the action. Everything else (network, 409 conflict, 5xx) is a
 * transient error (State D) that keeps the existing toast path.
 *
 * This classifier is deliberately pure and framework-free so it can be unit
 * tested exhaustively without a DOM. `classifySkillDenial()` returns `null` for
 * State A (allowed / nothing to show) and State D (transient — let the caller
 * toast it); the UI renders a persistent banner only for B and C.
